          <h6>Software development at <mark>Sticker Control</mark></h6>
          <h6>Boulder, CO <small class="text-muted">Fall 2018</small></h6>

          <h6>Data conversion at <mark>The National Oceanic and Atmoshperic Administration</mark></h6>
          <h6>Boulder, CO <small class="text-muted">Fall 2016 &ndash; Spring 2017</small></h6>
          <p>I worked here during the 2016/17 school year. I was brought on to convert several decades worth of historical climate data into a data file called <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/" target="_blank">NetCDF</a>. This meant creating lots of scripting tools to convert dozens of different types of plain-text data files. This was released as a package of Python scripts. You can see some of the finished project in <a href="https://github.com/franklinharvey/NOAA-NetCDF-Radiation" target="_blank">this Github repo</a>.</p>

          <h6>Boulder, CO <small class="text-muted">Fall 2017</small></h6>
          <p>I was hired onto the AQTreks team to build the web-app version of their existing iOS and Android apps. I built full user-authentication, data visualizations for both time-based and geographic data, and a marketing landing page for the project. Unfortunately I cannot share the code for this project, but I can say we used <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a>, <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet.js</a>, the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/" target="_blank">Google Maps API</a>, on a LAMP stack.</p>

          <p>At Travelport I was assigned an internship project that involved making a full prototype for the iOS version of their upcoming web application.

          <h6>Boulder, CO <small class="text-muted">Fall 2015 &ndash; Fall 2016</small></h6>
          <p>I actually had two jobs at CU. The first was an internship with the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cwa/" target="_blank">Conference on World Affairs</a>. With the CWA I designed a lot of promo material for events throughout the year, and I also designed their 2016 program, which was a 70+ page document I made in InDesign.</p>
          <p>My second job at CU was as a graphic for the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/pts/" target="_blank">Parking and Transportation</a> department.
