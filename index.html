                I primarily focussed on building a frontend built with React,

                Jest and Enzyme, end-to-end testing in Cypress, and we used
                Concourse as our CI/CD pipeline. Because of our need for
                realtime data flows and performance-optimized interfaces we did
                a lot of our networking over WebSockets and message brokers like
